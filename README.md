# Rusty Data Hound

Data hound will listen and log all traffic on 80 and 443 (excluding SYN, ACK, and FIN packets). Will log the hostname and the number of requests it has sent to your computer.

## History
I wanted a way to monitor all the web traffic my computer was reciving, specially to view all the garbage requests for ads and spam. 
This was strictly for fun to teach myself Rust and pcap.


*I can safely guarantee this will not work well ;) but it was fun to build.*
